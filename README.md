# DataVisualization_Using_Java
 To implement the tables that contain the item names & amount & using that information generate a pie chart and Bar Graph from the class JfreeChart.

This project demonstrates data visualization techniques using Java. It includes functionalities to create Pie Charts and Bar Charts from user-input data. The application is built using Java Swing and JFreeChart libraries.

## Features

- Add data (Items and Amounts) through a user-friendly interface.
- Display data in a tabular format.
- Generate Pie Charts and Bar Charts based on the input data.
- Reset functionality to clear data and start over.

## Project Structure

- **Main.java**: The main entry point of the application.
- **PieChart.java**: Contains the logic for creating and displaying Pie Charts and Bar Charts.

## Dependencies
